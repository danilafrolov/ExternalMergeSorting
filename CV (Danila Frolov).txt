Software developer (Department of GIS-software development) 

Participated in the development of the following projects: 
* Automatic design system for mine surveyors
Client-server web-application which is designed for automation of processes performed by mine surveyours in the area of geological and surveying support for designing and drilling of wells. 
The main functions of the application:
o Centralized data storage of wells, well clusters, fields, which simplifies company’s geodata management (access, requesting, analyzing, modification)
o Updating wells database allows receiving operational reporting about well stock
o Clustering of wells according to their location and data visualization on the map
Technologies:
o Back-end: C#, ASP.NET MVC + WebAPI, NHibernate, PostgreSQL (PostGIS)
o Front-end: Vue.js + JavaScript libraries (Plotly.js, OpenLayers.js, etc.), HTML/CSS

* AutoCAD and GeoServer (PostGIS) integration
Desktop plugins for AutoCAD designed for integration with geodata source (PostGIS, GeoServer). 
The main function of the plugin is data exchange between AutoCAD and GeoServer. The plugin receives geodata from GeoServer (by WFS) and converts it to AutoCAD data features and creates a drawing, so user works with it as with usual AutoCAD drawing. When the work is finished, plugin provides reverse process: receiving data from the drawing and sending It back to GeoServer.
Technologies: C#, Windows Forms, ADO.NET Entity Framework, GeoServer (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)
